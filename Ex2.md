### Description<br>
Imagine that you have many types of protein bars and you are required to take this bars and make it easier for people to find their specific goals. Some of them are maybe interested to eat as much protein (Bodybuilder players I guess) as they can and some of them are interested about eating kolhydrat and so on.
You will have the protein bars information represented in XML file.


### Task<br>
Write Java code with the following functionality(Text Interface Program as the IP Project):<br>
   Extract the information into a data structure of ur choice.<br>
   After that give the user the ability to choose from:  <br>
   <ul>
     <li> Show all the bars with the names and the reviewing part.</li>
	<li>```xml  Ex: <ILSAHBAR  SN="VyfdmYr"> <review>
			<reviewer personID="PJ8">
				<date>2014-02-11</date>
				<score>4</score>
			</reviewer>   
		</review>
		```
		</li>
        <li> Sort based on highest Protein ( Ex: 1- 36g , 2- 30g ,3- 10g). </li>
          <li>Sort based on highest Fett. </li>
          <li> Filter bars which has less than “some number from the user” fiber and sort them from highest to lowest.</li>
           <li>find all protein bars with more than X protein reviewed by Y (X and Y should be entered from the user).</li>
</ul>
  
### Open question<br>
Imagine that you have a very large database. How do you think that the memory will behave with the database if u save it in a data structure ? Are there any problems? If yes, then how to fix it.<br>
What is the best data structure to be used in this situation. Motivate!<br>


### Database<br>
The database will look like this:
```xml
<products>
    	<ILSAHBAR  SN="VyfdmYr">
		<fett>27.19</fett>
		<energy>1288.07</energy>
		<kolhydrat>25.96</kolhydrat>
		<protein>39.49</protein>
		<fiber>44.04</fiber>
		<review>
			<reviewer personID="PJ8">
				<date>2014-02-11</date>
				<score>4</score>
			</reviewer>   
		</review>
	</ILSAHBAR>


	<OHRITBAR  SN="pQEk83O">
